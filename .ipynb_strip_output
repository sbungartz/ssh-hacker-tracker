"""strip outputs from an IPython Notebook

This does mostly the same thing as the `Clear All Output` command in the notebook UI.

Adapted from rom https://gist.github.com/minrk/6176788 to work with
git filter driver

Copied and adapted (execution_count = None instead of 0 as generated by notebook UI)
from https://github.com/jond3k/ipynb_stripout/blob/74c27261da0106e7ac43b1c453436654c38854a7/ipynb_stripout
